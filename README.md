Ajaxify
=======

Ajaxify helpes the developer to simplify the usage of Ajax on a Magento plateform.

Iâ€™ve tried to make the module simple for now, which of course can be extended a lot to incorporate all kinds of needs. 
But for now, if I may say, there are roughly these two things you might want to do (Purely in Magento terms).

1. Request to a controller with params, do some changes in the model, set error/success message and show those 
   message to the user.
2. Next, perform all the actions as #1 and in addition to that refresh the content of certain HTML elements.

This module has been devised just to meet these two actions. In addition, the module is loader ready and has by default 
a floating message block.
